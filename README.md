# user-list

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Build & development

- **grunt serve** for preview 
- **grunt** for build but haven't tried build - maybe better not to build ;-)

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Notes

Things I may not get to before you clone:
- Accordion doesn't auto close other items like I intended (I think it's an issue with accordion template)
- Console may show Google Map API Key notice. Key is added but sometimes console shows message
- Normally I would follow John Papa style guide
- No real effort to optimize
